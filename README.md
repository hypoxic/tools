Various Tools I've created or use    
    
***movfixlongs*** - Arm optimizers sometimes do a discontinuous MOVT from MOVW and therefore IDA doesn't dissassemble correctly. This puts them back together. Unfortunately doesn't work with condtional MOVs.

***pbnano decode*** - Tool do parse a pbnano binary into a human readable json file
